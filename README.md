WCRT  -  Win32API CRT

About
-----

WCRT is a small C runtime library for Visual C++, which implements parts
of its functionality through calls to the Win32API. It is meant as a
replacement for the Visual C runtime library (libc.lib).

The main purpose of this library is to allow the creation of small
statically linked executables from regular C source files.

Please read the documentation file 'doc/WCRT-1.12.chm'.

The original code (x86 Windows) was written in 2006 by Joergen Ibsen / Jibz
(http://www.ibsensoftware.com/).  This instance of it is an attempt to update 
wcrt to be 64-bit compatible.
